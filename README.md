# Bowling The Scream

This game is inspired by "The Scream" by Edvard Munch.

I have seen a lot of memes making fun of this famous artwork, although the context had nothing to do with any positive emotion. It was describing the person's panic, fear and anxiety, which make the him/her screamed. So, I'd like to create a game that recreate the fear in an interesting way, which is a bowling game. I believe that by throwing a giant bowling to a person who stands still would absolutely makes him/her screams.
